 Design and develop an efficient, accurate Smart Weed Cutting Robot that  can follow the line and eliminate weeds in agricultural fields, gardens, and  other outdoor spaces, minimizing damage to crops, reducing the reliance on  herbicides and reduce labour cost  while adapting to diverse  weed species, growth stages, and environmental conditions.
It uses ESP32 microcontroller board, ultrasonic sensor and Blynk IoT app. Real time data is sent via bluetooth to android app.
